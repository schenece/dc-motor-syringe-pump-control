# ECEN 611 Mini Project

This repository contains the files and resources for my ECEN 611 mini project. The project primarily involves MATLAB, with potential future additions of Simulink models and reference materials related to the project.

## Repository Structure

- **MATLAB Files**: Core scripts and functions that are essential for the project's calculations and simulations.
- **Simulink Models** (Planned): This folder will contain Simulink files if needed for modeling and simulation tasks.
- **References**: A collection of research papers and other reference materials relevant to the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ECEN-611-mini-project.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Run the main MATLAB files for simulations and calculations.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (latest version recommended)
- [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) (for future model additions)
- Any additional toolboxes required will be listed within individual MATLAB files.

## Usage

Each script is designed to be modular and can be run independently. Detailed usage instructions and descriptions of each file's purpose are provided as comments within the scripts.

## Future Work

- Add Simulink models as needed.
- Continue updating the references section with relevant research papers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
